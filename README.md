# Decision-making-statements-Cpp

Aim: Demonstrate decision-making statements in C++. (if-else, switch-case)

Theory:

Decision-making statements in C++ allow a program to make choices based on certain conditions. These conditions typically evaluate to either true or false (boolean values). Based on the result, different blocks of code are executed, enabling the program to perform different actions in different situations.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Decision-Making Statements
C++ provides the following types of decision-making statements:
| Statement Type   | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `if`             | Executes a block of code if the condition is true             |
| `if...else`      | Executes one block if the condition is true, another if false |
| `else if` ladder | Tests multiple conditions in sequence                         |
| `nested if`      | `if` statement inside another `if`                            |
| `switch`         | Selects one of many possible blocks to execute                |


Conclusion:
Decision-making statements in C++ provide the logic and control necessary for building interactive and responsive programs. Using constructs like if, if-else, else-if, and switch, programmers can guide the programâ€™s behavior based on inputs, calculations, or conditions. Mastery of these statements is essential for any C++ programmer.
